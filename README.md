# neural_nets

Playground for deep learning applications.

## Achieved use cases

* Looping over GridSearchCV to assist the choice of layout of a multi-layer perceptron
* Classifier for 'occupancy' in a room, based on ambient sensors
* Classify IRIS dataset with Keras
* An LSTM to generate text like Nietsche's

## Planned use cases

* Forecasting energy demand time series
* The most simple perceptron model, at which training results can be examined
